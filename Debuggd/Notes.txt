Property names in configuration classes:

Property names in .json configuration files should be named exactly as Property values of Configuration classes. 
Decorating properties with attributes [DataMember] and [JsonProperty] are not valid. (see answer from poke)

There is possible workaround, but it is not recommended to use because of good coding practices and code maintenance. (answer from 'Veikedo')
